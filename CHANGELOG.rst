* Update the onboarding status to take into account sections that are not accessible to the user
  or has a release date in the future. For sections with release dates in the future,

[3.7.7] - 2021-03-08

* Change use of get_active_enrollments_by_course method of the LMS Enrollments service to
  get_enrollments_can_take_proctored_exams, which is more performant. This shifts the responsibility

[3.6.0] - 2021-02-19

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add a new interstitial for exam attempts in the "ready_to_resume" state to
  indicate to learner that their exam attempt is ready to be resumed and to
  prompt the learner to resume their exam.

  users enrollment mode.

[2.6.1] - 2021-01-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add a dropdown component.
* If the "data-enable-exam-resume-proctoring-improvements" data attribute on the element of the ProctoredExamAttemptView
  Backbone is true,

  * use the dropdown menu component on the Instructor Dashboard Proctored Exam Attempt panel for proctored exam attempts in the error state, providing the following options:

    * Resume, which transitions the exam attempt into the ready_to_resume state.
    * Reset, which behaves the same as the previous reset functionality, originally exposed via the [x] link.
  * change the [x] link to Reset for exam attempts in other states.

* If the "data-enable-exam-resume-proctoring-improvements" data attribute on the element of the ProctoredExamAttemptView Backbone is
  false there is no change.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added `is_attempt_active` field to ProctoredExamSoftwareSecureReview and
  ProctoredExamSoftwareSecureReviewHistory models to note if the attempt for
  that review has been archived. When an attempt is archived and if it is associated
  with a review, this field will be set to False

[2.5.8] - 2021-01-12

  This fixes a bug where the status would return `verified` even after all attempts had
  been deleted.

[2.5.7] - 2021-01-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Allow the creation of multiple exam attempts for a single user in a single exam, as long
  as the most recent attempt is `ready_to_resume` or `resumed`. When an exam is resumed, the
  time remaining is saved to the new attempt and is used to calculate the expiration time.

[2.5.6] - 2021-01-06
