This is the exam proctoring subsystem for the Open edX platform.

Overview
--------

Proctored exams are exams with time limits that learners complete while online
proctoring software monitors their computers and behavior for activity that
might be evidence of cheating. This Python library provides the proctoring
implementation used by Open edX.

Documentation
-------------

For authoring documentation, see `Including Proctored Exams In Your Course`_.

Installation
------------

To install edx-proctoring:

    mkvirtualenv edx-proctoring
    make install

To run the tests:

    make test-all

For a full list of Make targets:

    make help

Configuration
-------------

In order to use edx-proctoring, you must obtain an account (and secret
configuration - see below) with SoftwareSecure, which provides the proctoring
review services that edx-proctoring integrates with.

You will need to turn on the ENABLE_SPECIAL_EXAMS in lms.env.json and
cms.env.json FEATURES dictionary::

    "FEATURES": {
        :
        "ENABLE_SPECIAL_EXAMS": true,
        :
    }

Also in your lms.env.json and cms.env.json file please add the following::


    "PROCTORING_SETTINGS": {
        "LINK_URLS": {
            "contact_us": "{add link here}",
            "faq": "{add link here}",
            "online_proctoring_rules": "{add link here}",
            "tech_requirements": "{add link here}"
        }
    },

In your lms.auth.json file, please add the following *secure* information::

    "PROCTORING_BACKENDS": {
        "software_secure": {
            "crypto_key": "{add SoftwareSecure crypto key here}",
            "exam_register_endpoint": "{add endpoint to SoftwareSecure}",
            "exam_sponsor": "{add SoftwareSecure sponsor}",
            "organization": "{add SoftwareSecure organization}",
            "secret_key": "{add SoftwareSecure secret key}",
            "secret_key_id": "{add SoftwareSecure secret key id}",
            "software_download_url": "{add SoftwareSecure download url}"
        },
        'DEFAULT': 'software_secure'
    },

You will need to restart services after these configuration changes for them to
take effect.

Debugging
------------

To debug with PDB, run ``pytest`` with the ``-n0`` flag. This restricts the number
of processes in a way that is compatible with ``pytest``

    pytest -n0 [file-path]
